# Simple Chatbot using NLTK and TensorFlow

This repository contains a simple chatbot implemented using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and TensorFlow. The chatbot is trained to respond to user queries based on predefined intents.

## Requirements

- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/): A powerful Python library for natural language processing.
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): An open-source machine learning framework.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk tensorflow

Usage

    Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Chatbot.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd Chatbot

Run the chatbot script:
python chatbot.py

Start a conversation with the chatbot. You can ask questions or give commands to the chatbot.

Training Data

The chatbot uses a JSON file (intents.json) for training data. You can customize this file to define intents and patterns for your chatbot. Each intent includes a set of patterns and responses.
{
    "intents": [
        {
            "tag": "greeting",
            "patterns": ["Hello", "Hi", "Hey"],
            "responses": ["Hello! How can I help you?", "Hi there!", "Hey!"]
        },
        {
            "tag": "goodbye",
            "patterns": ["Goodbye", "See you later", "Bye"],
            "responses": ["Goodbye!", "See you later!", "Bye bye!"]
        },
        {
            "tag": "thanks",
            "patterns": ["Thanks", "Thank you", "Appreciate it"],
            "responses": ["You're welcome!", "No problem!", "Anytime!"]
        },
        // Add more intents here
    ]
}

You can extend and modify the intents in this file to teach your chatbot new responses.
Model Training

The chatbot uses a neural network model for intent recognition. If you need to retrain the model or train it with new data, follow these steps:

    Update the intents.json file with your changes.
    Run the chatbot.py script to retrain the model.

The trained model will be saved as model.tflearn in the project directory.
Customization

Feel free to customize and extend the chatbot according to your needs. You can add more intents, improve responses, or integrate it into other applications.
