Trust me, it's an easier way out than whatever asinine plan your friend came up with.","Think about this.","It has been replaced with a live-fire course designed for military androids.","Didn't we have some fun, though?","It's funny, actually, when you think about it.","Someday we'll remember this and laugh. and laugh. and laugh. Oh boy. Well. You may as well come on back.","Good people don't end up here.","Can you hear me?","This is your fault. It didn't have to be like this.","You don't even care. Do you?","Oh, it will. Believe me, it will.","She did all the work.","Certain objects may be vital to your success; Do not destroy testing apparatus.", "Vital testing apparatus destroyed.","Because despite your violent behavior, the only thing you've managed to break so far is my heart.","Maybe you could settle for that and we'll just call it a day.","I guess we both know that isn't going to happen.", "Time out for a second. That wasn't supposed to happen.","Do you see that thing that fell out of me? What is that? It's not the surprise... I've never seen it before.","I thought about our dilemma, and I came up with a solution that I honestly think works out best for one of both of us.","That's right. The facility is completely operational again.","Never mind. It's a mystery I'll solve later... By myself... Because you'll be dead.","I love it too. There's just one small thing we need to take care of first.","Sorry about the mess. I've really let the place go since you killed me. By the way, thanks for that.","Oh, that's sad. But impressive. Maybe they worked at the phone company.","Well, you know the old formula: Comedy equals tragedy plus time. And you have been asleep for a while. So I guess it's actually pretty funny when you do the math.","Here, let me get that for you.","You know, if you'd done that to somebody else, they might devote their existences to exacting revenge.","Luckily I'm a bigger person than that. I'm happy to put this all behind us and get back to work. After all, we've got a lot to do, and only sixty more years to do it. More or less. I don't have the actuarial tables in front of me.","I'll just move that out of the way for you. This place really is a wreck.","After that...who knows? I might take up a hobby. Reanimating the dead, maybe.","Go ahead and grab another one.","Enjoy this next test. I'm going to go to the surface. It's a beautiful day out. Yesterday I saw a deer. If you solve this next test, maybe I'll let you ride an elevator all the way up to the break room, and I'll tell you about the time I saw a deer again.","Well, you passed the test. I didn't see the deer today. I did see some humans. But with you here I've got more test subjects than I'll ever need.", "If you think trapping yourself is going to make me stop testing, you're sorely mistaken. Here's another cube.", "I made it all up.", "Perfect, the door's malfunctioning. I guess somebody's going to have to repair that too. No, don't get up. I'll be right back. Don't touch anything.", "I went and spoke with the door mainframe. Let's just say he won't be... well, living anymore. Anyway, back to testing.", "I'm going through the list of test subjects in cryogenic storage. I managed to find two with your last name. A man and a woman. So that's interesting. It's a small world."]
